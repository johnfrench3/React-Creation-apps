# Contributing to ReactCreations

Welcome to ReactCreations! We're excited to have you contribute to our open-source project. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, there are plenty of ways to get involved.

## Repository Motive

Our project aims to contribute more and build more open-source projects using React Js. We believe in the power of collaboration and open-source contributions. By joining us, you'll be part of a vibrant community working towards a common goal. Your contributions will not only enhance the project but also help you improve your skills and connect with like-minded individuals.

## How to Get Started with Open Source

Here's a quick rundown on how to get started with open source and some basic terminologies:

- **Git**: Git is a versioning system that lets you store your code and code history on your local computer, preventing losses and allowing sharing of that code.

- **GitHub**: GitHub is a server that lets you store the history in a database.

- **Open Source**: A project is said to be open-sourced if you can see the code on GitHub.

- **Fork**: This is a copy that you make of a project on GitHub; it gets added to your repositories.

- **Repository**: A project on GitHub is called a repository.

- **Pull Request**: This is a fix for an issue proposed to be done in a project; this consists of you editing a file in the project.

- **Issue**: An issue is a change that should be done in a project; it can be a bug, a new feature, or a suggestion to a project.

- **Branch**: A branch is a new workspace derived from the default workspace (main or master); it allows you to work on something without affecting the original code.

- **Star**: When you star a repository, it gets saved in your profile, and you can easily revisit it later.

Now that you know some basic terms, let's get into how to get started with some resources to help you understand open source better:

## Contributing

We heartily welcome any and all contributions that match our engineering standards! üôå

That being said, this codebase isn't your typical open source project because it's not a library or package with a limited scope‚Äîit's our entire product.

Contributions make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.

Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.

Check out our [contribution guidelines](#) for more information.

## Rules

1. **No console.logs in any file**: We use the debug module across the codebase to log debugging information in development only. Never commit a file that contains a console.log as CI will fail your build. The only exceptions are errors, which you can log, but you have to use console.error to be explicit about it.

2. **Code reviews**: All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.

3. **Don't forget to leave a star‚ú®**

## How to Contribute

Here's how you can contribute to ReactCreations:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking our repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the project that you can freely experiment with.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ReactCreations.git

3. **Make Changes**: Add your project in a separate folder. Whether it's adding a new project or improving documentation, your contribution is valuable.

4. **Add to Staging Area**: Use the following command to add your changes to the staging area:
git add <path to the file you worked on>

5. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message explaining the purpose of the changes:
git commit -m "Add your commit message here"


6. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub:
git push origin main

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository on GitHub and click on the "New Pull Request" button. Compare your branch with the main repository's branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes in the pull request, and submit it for review.

8. **Wait for Review and Merge**: Once you've submitted a pull request, our team will review your changes. Be patient during this process and be ready to address any feedback or questions. Once your changes are approved, they will be merged into the main project.
